# Projects

Here are some projects I'm working on.

=> gmid.gmi             gmid - dead simple zero configuration gemini server
(If you're browsing this page over gemini this is the server that you're talking to.)  A simple, secure, Gemini server for static content with CGI support.  Written for fun with libtls.

=> vc-got.gmi           Emacs VC backend for Game of Trees

=> star-platinum.gmi    star-platinum - take control of your applications, one key at the time
It's a keybinding manager for X11.  It lets you assign keys on other application and bind custom action to them.  You can execute external commands or send fake keys.  I'm using it to "emacs-ify" firefox, but can do more.

=> webpkg.gmi		WebPKG - web-interface for the OpenBSD ports collection
CGI script to search for and visualise package from the OpenBSD port tree.  Supports full-text search across the whole catalogue.

=> crest.gmi            CREST - see your rest endpoints
Interactive REPL for HTTP requests with a simple and intuitive language.

=> sam-el.gmi           sam.el - An editor for the best OS
sam.el is an implementation of the text editor sam from plan9 for emacs.  It's still far, far away from being usable.

=> mymenu.gmi           mymenu – a menu of mine
mymenu is a graphical menu for X11.  It reads items from standard input (one per line) and present a window where the user can choose one (or more) item.  It’s similar to dmenu, except it’s better (IMHO).
