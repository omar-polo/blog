# gmid

gmid is a small, almost no-dependencies, gemini server for static content.  I wrote it because I needed one and I disliked the ones that I found (or I wasn't able to compile them)

It's a very short C program (less than 500 lines of code at the moment), that uses libtls (a GREAT tls library from the OpenBSD folks.)

It doesn't support virtual hosts (it completely ignores the host part of the requested URL) and can only serve static content.

You can fetch the code with git
```
git clone https://git.omarpolo.com/gmid
```
or via the github mirror
```
git clone https://github.com/omar-polo/gmid
```

## Future plans

This is mostly a TODO/wish list of things, just to get an idea of what I'm gonna do (and to remind to myself too).

* performance
I don't want to over-engineer this, but at least I would like to replace the na√Øve accept-read-write loop with a slightly more sophisticated one based on poll(2).

* MIME types
At the moment I'm serving every file with the text/gemini MIME type.  It's still OK for my current use case, but I need to fix this.

* virtual hosts
mapping hosts to different directories would be really handy

* directory listings
It's currently not supported, and I'm not even sure it could be useful.
