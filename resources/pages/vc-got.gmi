# vc-got.el

vc-got.el is an Emacs VC backend for the Game of Tree VCS.

=> https://gameoftrees.org/ Game of Tree website

It’s still WIP, there are some unfinished parts, but is usable (I’m using almost every day).

You can fetch the code with git:
```
$ git clone https://git.omarpolo.com/vc-got
```
or via the github mirror:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/omar-polo/vc-got
```
