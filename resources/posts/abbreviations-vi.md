Sometimes you use a tool for years and still have something new to
learn. I'm talking about `vi(1)`, not vim or nvim, but nvi! (the
OpenBSD ones at least.)

While I was reading [NetBSD desktop pt.6 "vi(1) editor, tmux and
unicode
`$TERM`"](https://www.unitedbsd.com/d/12-netbsd-desktop-pt-6-vi1-editor-tmux-and-unicode-term)

I knew vim end emacs had abbreviations, but I never thought that vi
has them too.

Now my `~/.nexrc` is more rich:

```vi
ab #d #define
ab #i #include
```
